changes made in opposing to buck's tutorial:
whats between """ """ is the code that has been added

1. added this code to the settings file beacuse authenticate always returned none!
"""
#Authentication backends
AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = (
    'django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend',
)
"""

2. the way to properly make a user (need to validate):
"""
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

password="examplepass"
user = User.objects.create(username="example",email="example@mail.com",password=password)

#set password as hash in database (no other way, has to be done)
user.set_password("examplepass")
#save user in db
user.save()

#validating the user
from django.contrib.auth import authenticate,login

#if password wont be saved right there will be problems here!
user = authenticate(username=user.username,password=password)
